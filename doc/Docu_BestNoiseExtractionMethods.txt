1. Power Spectral Density (PSD) Denoising
=========================================
   
    Strengths for Online Monitoring:
    ================================
        Simple and computationally lightweight, making it suitable for real-time applications.
        Provides a broad overview of noise distribution across frequencies.

    Limitations for PD Monitoring:
    ============================== 
        Less effective at distinguishing between noise and transient PD pulses.
        May not preserve sharp features of PD signals, which are critical for accurate detection.

    Verdict:
	========
	    Best suited for preliminary noise floor estimation but not ideal for 
	    detailed PD pulse extraction in noisy environments.

2. Wiener Denoise Technique
===========================

    Strengths for Online Monitoring:
    ================================
        Adaptive filtering allows it to handle varying noise levels, 
		which is common in transformer environments.
        Effective at reducing Gaussian noise, a common noise type in high-voltage systems.
        Preserves signal characteristics better than PSD-based methods.

    Limitations for PD Monitoring:
    ==============================
        Requires accurate noise estimation, which can be challenging in real-time applications.
        Computationally heavier than PSD, but still feasible for online systems with sufficient processing power.

    Verdict: 
	========
	    A strong candidate for online PD monitoring, especially in environments 
	    with relatively stable noise characteristics.

3. Wavelet Wiener Denoise Technique
===================================

    Strengths for Online Monitoring:
    ================================
        Excellent at preserving transient features of PD signals, which are crucial for accurate detection and analysis.

        Well-suited for non-stationary signals, making it ideal for the dynamic noise environment of power transformers.

        Can effectively separate PD pulses from background noise, even when the pulses are buried in noise.

    Limitations for PD Monitoring:
    ==============================
        Computationally intensive, which may challenge real-time implementation on low-resource systems.

        Requires careful selection of wavelet bases and thresholds, which may need tuning for specific transformer setups.

    Verdict:
    ========	
	    The most effective method for PD monitoring in terms of accuracy and feature preservation, 
	    but its computational demands must be addressed for real-time applications.
