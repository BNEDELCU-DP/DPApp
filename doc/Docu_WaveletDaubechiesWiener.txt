
1. Why Use Daubechies Wavelets (db6)?
=====================================
    db6 (Daubechies-6) is chosen because:
        It has a compact support and smooth basis functions.
        Well-suited for analyzing signals with sharp transients (such as noise).
        Balances between time and frequency resolution.
    Alternatives:
        db4: Good for generic signals.
        sym8: Symlet, improved symmetry.
        coif5: Better time localization.

2. What is the Importance of Decomposition Levels? (level=5)
============================================================
    The level determines how deep the wavelet transform goes:
        Higher levels capture lower frequencies.
        Lower levels capture higher frequencies (including noise).
    A good rule of thumb for choosing level:
    Max level=log⁡2(length of signal)
    Max level=log2​(length of signal)
    Since we have a 10 MHz signal and want to filter the 1 MHz - 5 MHz range, level=5 provides a good balance.

3. Why Use Wiener Filtering on Detail Coefficients?
===================================================
    The Wiener filter is adaptive:
        It estimates the noise variance in different scales.
        Reduces noise while preserving the actual signal.
    We only apply it to detail coefficients (coeffs[1:]), because noise mostly exists in higher frequencies.

Summary
=======
    Wavelet transform splits the signal into frequency bands.
    Wiener filter smooths noise in the high-frequency bands.
    Inverse wavelet transform reconstructs the clean signal.
    Daubechies-6 (db6) is a good wavelet for general signal denoising.
    Level = 5 ensures we filter frequencies between 1 MHz and 5 MHz.
